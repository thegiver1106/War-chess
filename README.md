# Stage of Development 
This project is currently in the stage of final release. Core mechanisms and level system are all included, as well as decent visuals. Also, the game is well-polished, and should be free of bugs.


# Description
This project is a strategic war game. The goal of each stage is to reach enemy's base while protecting your own base. During the gameplay, you need to deploy all your divisions of multiple classes wisely to have an edge when engaging the enemy, and choose your tactics carefully. Also, the terrain will have an influence on combat outcomes and movement speed, so you need to plan the route of each division.
